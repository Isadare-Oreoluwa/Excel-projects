**Key Highlights:**
- **Dataset:** Includes sales transaction data from various regions, categorized by market, store, product line, and trade size.
- **Revenue Analysis:** Pivot tables were used to assess regional contributions, with the Service Plan emerging as the top revenue generator, particularly in the North East region.
- **Market Segmentation:** Trades were categorized into Extra Large, Large, Medium, and Small, providing insights into market performance by size.
